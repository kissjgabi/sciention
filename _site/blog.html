      <h2><a href="/sciention/lifestyle/2020/04/04/Work.html">Work</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Emails:</strong> Keep emails to 5 sentences or less. It saves time for both you and the recipient. Being concise also helps you to be clearer and more direct, which will reduce miscommunication issues later on.</p>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <h2><a href="/sciention/lifestyle/2020/04/04/Relationships.html">Relationships</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Listening:</strong> Take what people say at face value. There is no need to waste your energy wondering what their ulterior motive is, or if they are not telling the truth about things. Keep it simple and accept their truth.</p>

    </li>
  
    <li>
      <h2><a href="/sciention/lifestyle/2020/04/04/Productivity.html">Productivity</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Procrastination:</strong> If you are avoiding a particular task, you are just wasting your time, and possibly other people’s time too. Set a timer for 25 minutes and use that time to get the task done. If you haven’t finished within that time period, take a 5 minute break, and set the timer again and resume working toward completing the task. This is called the Pomodoro Technique. It really works.</p>

    <li>
      <h2><a href="/sciention/lifestyle/2020/04/04/Lifestyle.html">Lifestyle</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Work/Life balance:</strong> No matter what work you do, create boundaries. When it’s work time, focus on your work. When it’s not work time, focus on your life. This is super simple, yet not everyone does it. You’ll find you are more productive in and out of work, have a better family life and feel happier.</p>

    </li>

      <h2><a href="/sciention/lifestyle/2020/04/04/Health.html">Health</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Instead of agonizing over which diet you should choose to go on, simply ask yourself what the healthiest foods are to eat. You already know the answer. Stick to that.</p>

      <h2><a href="/sciention/programming/2016/05/20/welcome-to-jekyll.html">Welcom to Jekyll</a></h2>
      <p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
