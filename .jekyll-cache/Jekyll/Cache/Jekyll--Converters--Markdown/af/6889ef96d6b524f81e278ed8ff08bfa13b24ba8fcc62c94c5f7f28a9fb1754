I"¤<p><strong>Procrastination:</strong> If you are avoiding a particular task, you are just wasting your time, and possibly other peopleâ€™s time too. Set a timer for 25 minutes and use that time to get the task done. If you havenâ€™t finished within that time period, take a 5 minute break, and set the timer again and resume working toward completing the task. This is called the Pomodoro Technique. It really works.</p>
