I"ñ<p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Instead of agonizing over which diet you should choose to go on, simply ask yourself what the healthiest foods are to eat. You already know the answer. Stick to that.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> It is not necessary to have a membership for a fancy gym, or to try the next big exercise fad, if these are things that will turn into a chore for you. Instead, try activities that you enjoy, such as Frisbee, hiking, dancing or riding your bike with the kids.</p>
